### Summary of the Methods

- **isPartialSuccess**: This method checks if the EDL response indicates partial success by evaluating the response status and the success of individual queries.

- **processEdlResponseException**: This method processes exceptions that occur during EDL response handling and updates the response mapping with appropriate error codes.

- **processEdlResp**: This method processes the EDL response and filters results based on zip code matching criteria.

- **matchZipcode**: This method checks if the zip code from the EDL response matches the applicant's zip code based on the specified country code.

- **getNodeNameForZipCodeMatch**: This method retrieves the appropriate node name for zip code matching based on whether the applicant is primary or secondary.

- **errorResponse**: This method constructs a structured JSON error response based on the provided error message and logging attributes.
