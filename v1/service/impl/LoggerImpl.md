Here is the Javadoc for the `LoggerImpl` class, including detailed explanations for all methods, formatted with HTML tags for clarity. This documentation focuses on the purpose and logic of each method without including the method implementations.

```java
package com.syf.synapps.iff.rest.service.impl;

/**
 * Implementation of the LoggerService interface.
 * This service is responsible for logging various aspects of the IFF response,
 * including microstandin logs and building JSON logs for Splunk.
 */
@Slf4j
@Service
public class LoggerImpl implements LoggerService {

    /**
     * Logs the microstandin information from the IFF response.
     * 
     * <p>This method performs the following steps:</p>
     * <ol>
     *     <li><strong>Parse IFF Response:</strong> The method reads the IFF response JSON string and extracts
     *     relevant fields such as the standin flag, return code, and return message.</li>
     *     <li><strong>Set MDC Values:</strong> The method sets various values in the Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)
     *     for logging purposes, including the transaction ID and return code.</li>
     *     <li><strong>Build Log Map:</strong> A log map is created to hold the final response and data source
     *     information.</li>
     *     <li><strong>Conditional Logging:</strong> Depending on the value of the standin flag, the method populates
     *     the log response with additional information from the monitor map.</li>
     *     <li><strong>Log the Response:</strong> The final log response is converted to a pretty-printed JSON string
     *     and logged at the info level.</li>
     * </ol>
     * 
     * @param iffResp        The IFF response as a JSON string.
     * @param returnResponse  The monitor return response object containing metadata.
     * @param resilienceDB    The resilience database fields to capture any errors.
     */
    @Override
    public void LogMicroStandin(String iffResp, MonitorReturnResponse returnResponse, ResilienceDbFields resilienceDB) {
        // Implementation omitted for brevity
    }

    /**
     * Builds a JSON log for Splunk based on the IFF response and logging attributes.
     * 
     * <p>This method performs the following steps:</p>
     * <ol>
     *     <li><strong>Parse IFF Response:</strong> The method reads the IFF response JSON string and extracts
     *     primary and secondary blocks.</li>
     *     <li><strong>Set Splunk Logging Attributes:</strong> The method sets various attributes in the
     *     <code>SplunkLogging</code> object based on the extracted data from the primary and secondary blocks.</li>
     *     <li><strong>Build Log Map:</strong> A log map is created to hold various flags and timing information
     *     for logging.</li>
     *     <li><strong>Conditional Logging:</strong> Depending on whether the standin flag is set, the method
     *     populates the log map with either SQL or EDL timing information.</li>
     *     <li><strong>Update Monitor Map:</strong> The constructed log map is added to the monitor return response
     *     object.</li>
     * </ol>
     * 
     * @param iffResponse     The IFF response as a JSON string.
     * @param splunkLogging   The Splunk logging object to populate with attributes.
     * @param returnResponse   The monitor return response object containing metadata.
     * @param resilienceDB    The resilience database fields to capture any errors.

### Summary of the Methods

- **LogMicroStandin**: This method logs the microstandin information from the IFF response, including parsing the response, setting MDC values, building a log map, and logging the final response.

- **buildLogJSON**: This method builds a JSON log for Splunk based on the IFF response and various logging attributes, including parsing the response, setting attributes in the `SplunkLogging` object, and updating the monitor return response.
